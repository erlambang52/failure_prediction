# Vibration Failure Mode Prediction

This project focuses on predicting failure types in fan by analyzing their vibration patterns. Vibration patterns captured from the fan are used as input data. By employing statistics & machine learning techniques, such as pattern recognition and classification algorithms, the model learns to associate specific vibration patterns with different failure types. The aim is to provide a predictive tool that can anticipate potential failures in fans based on their vibration signatures, enabling timely maintenance and minimizing downtime.
